//A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
//
//For example, these are arithmetic sequence:
//
//1, 3, 5, 7, 9
//7, 7, 7, 7
//3, -1, -5, -9
//The following sequence is not arithmetic.
//
//1, 1, 2, 5, 7
